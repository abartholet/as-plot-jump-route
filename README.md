# Plot Jump Route
AstroSynthesis plugin to plot jump routes between stars

This plugin will find the route with the fewest number of jumps between two 
systems based on the given maximum jump distance and the systems 
considered to be valid jump points.  This will only run on the visible 
systems making it easier to filter out political affiliations and 
subsystems that you may wish to avoid.
